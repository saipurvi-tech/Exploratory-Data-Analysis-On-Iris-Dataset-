# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-On-Iris-Dataset-
A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset to visualize patterns, relationships, and feature distributions among different Iris species. This project highlights data cleaning, statistical insights, and visual exploration using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

### Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris dataset, one of the most well-known datasets in data science. The aim is to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships among different features of Iris flowers — Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.


### Problem Statement

To analyze and visualize the Iris dataset to identify key patterns, correlations, and differences between flower species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This exploration serves as a foundation for building accurate machine learning classification models.


### Methodology

Data Importing – Loaded the dataset using pandas.

Data Inspection – Checked shape, structure, and summary statistics of the data.

Data Cleaning – Verified that there were no missing or duplicate values.

Visualization 

Created scatter plots to study relationships between features.

Drew histograms and distribution plots to analyze feature spread.

Used color coding by species to highlight differences visually.

Insights – Observed that petal dimensions are highly discriminative among species, whereas sepal dimensions overlap more.


### Tools & Libraries

`Python` 

`pandas` – Data handling and analysis

`matplotlib` – Data visualization

`seaborn` – Advanced plotting and styling


### Conclusion
The EDA revealed that petal length and petal width are the most important features for classifying Iris species. The dataset is clean, balanced, and well-structured, making it ideal for further predictive modeling. This project demonstrates how visualization and analysis can simplify understanding of data patterns.
